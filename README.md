# buffer-overflow-c-
This is a demo for buffer overflow to see how it works in c++ using the strcpy command in chars
where when the user places more than 8 chars(it isnt restricted) then it will take more space then required from the other places this will overwrite the data and might give priviliged data and this will lead to the loss or leak of data
